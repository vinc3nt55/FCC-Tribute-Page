					<h1>With her knowledge of local food properties, Orosa also made contributions in the culinary realm.</h1>
						<p><span>1893 – 1945</span> She experimented with foods native to the Philippines and formulated food products like calamansi nip, a desiccated and powdered form of calamansi that could be used to make calamansi juice, banana ketchup, and a powdered preparation of soybeans called Soyalac, a "magic food" preparation which helped save the lives of thousands of Filipinos, Americans, and other nationals who were held prisoner in different Japanese concentration camps during World War II.</p>

						<p><span>In 1915</span> She enrolled in the University of the Philippines to study pharmacy. She was not able, however, to finish the course in Manila. She was sent to the United States by the government to continue her studies. She finished her pharmacy course in America in 1918. Then she studied food chemistry. While studying in the United States, Maria had to work in order to have enough money for her expenses. She washed dishes in the restaurants, scrubbed floors, picked fruits, and worked in canning factories. The United States government paid only part of her expenses.</p>

						<p><span>In 1922</span> Maria returned to the Philippines. Upon her return she taught home economics in the Centro Escolar University. Then in 1923 she transferred to the Bureau of Science. It was in this Bureau that she worked out different methods of preserving fruits, foods, and fruit juices. She also found a way to make darak edible. Darak is a valuable food element that can help cure patients suffering from beri-beri. With her helpers Maria then taught many housewives how to preserve such native foods as adobo, mechado, dinuguan, and to convert our fruits as guavas, mangoes into jelly. Maria gave lectures on food preservation in the provinces.</p>

						<p><span>In 1928</span> The Government saw her excellent work, then She was asked to study the best methods of food preservation. After studying again in the United States, she visited China, Hawaii, Holland, England, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France to observe their ways of preserving foods.</p>

						<p><span>In 1929</span> Maria returned and devoted her time to teaching home making to other women. She encouraged them to form rural improvement clubs. The purposes of these clubs were:<br><br>
						1. To learn and teach home making.<br>
						2. To learn and teach child care.<br>
						3. To learn and teach meal planning.<br>
						4. To learn and teach food preparation and preservation.<br>
						5. To learn and teach poultry raising.<br>
						6. To learn and teach gardening.<br><br>
						Maria worked hard to organize such clubs all over the country. She had organized 537 clubs by 1941. Maria encouraged the members to engage in home industries such as making slippers, rugs, and baskets. Maria hoped that through her work she would improve the health of mothers and children of the country. She also believed that homes with gardens would be better places to live in.</p>

						<p><span>In 1945</span> Maria was at work at the Bureau of Plant Industry in San Andres. She was hit by shrapnel during the bombing. Her friends rushed her to the Remedios Hospital in Malate. Then the hospital itself was hit by bombs. The bombs killed Maria and other patients. By the death of Maria Orosa, the country lost a woman who had devoted all her life to the service of the people. One of the buildings of the Bureau of Plants Industry where she worked has been named after her. It is called the Maria Y. Orosa building. The great work which Maria Orosa started goes on today. Many people whom she trained and taught carry on the work of improving the life of the common people.</p>
